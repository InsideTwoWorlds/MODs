[1.6]

This is a modification to show up ingame detailed stats about an enemy. Betatester of patch 1.4 will know this modification as it was part of the Betatest.

For this mod you need to create a new char (MP/SP).

The detailed enemy stats will allow you to see it all. So use with caution. This will also make Multi Player a completely transparent place. You will lose all the challenge there is. Use it at own risk.
