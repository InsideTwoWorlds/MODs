[There are currently two versions, one for 1.5 and one for 1.6. This description is for the 1.5 version but it is unclear which one this is.]

High atop a plateau sits the, Three Towers Manion. A home for the player with all of the amenities.. it has;

- High Scenic Views with stome overhange for thos vitsa views
- Teleporter
- Life Regen Shrine
- Mana Regen
- Richly decorted inside with paintings and "Head" trophies..
- Towers adorned with Flags and fire to light up at night
- Lights that turn on/off by the player throught the house ,also a "porch" light
- Ruins and outdoor objects "bring" the setting to "life"
- Of course three of the best horses in game including the "Skeleton" horse.
- Plenty of wardrobes, chests to keep your "loot" in..

This mod should be capatable with ALL mods. I have not tested it to date with Reynen's Character changing mod, as I do not have it, BUT it should work with that one to.. Let me know if it doesn't and I will then test it with that mod to see whay it is not compatible.

The only mod it does not work with is my first "MagesHouse" mod.
DO NOT USE WITH "MAGESHOUSE MOD" !!!!

This mod is intended to be a upgrade and replacement to my earlier MagesHouse mod.

Let me know what you think and any comments you might have on it..

As always you MUST start a new game for it to function correctly but that will soon be fixed to work with all old saved games..


Cheers
