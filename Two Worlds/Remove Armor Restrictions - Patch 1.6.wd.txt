This will remove all the restrictions for plate armor, meaning you will be able to dual wield, use the bow, and swim in it.

All people who play MP will need this as everyone has to has the same TwoWorlds.par file.
Otherwise this is just for single player.
So if you play online with friends make sure everyone has the mod.

Originally made by Reynen Starfyre.

This is a new version for patch 1.6
