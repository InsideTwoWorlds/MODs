This will remove all the restrictions for plate armor, meaning you will be able to dual wield, use the bow, and swim in it. I will make sure to include this mod in all future mods created by me.

All people who play MP will need this as everyone has to has the same TwoWorlds.par file.
Otherwise this is just for single player.
So if you play on lan with friends make sure everyone has the mod.

Enjoy
