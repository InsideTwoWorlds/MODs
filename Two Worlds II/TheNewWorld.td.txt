This mod was download here. However, some of the files for TNW 
(their file name ends with TNW) I have in this
archive aren't in the download in the link, and Nexus has been known to rarely
take down mods, so I also see little harm saving it on here. I'm almost
certain TNW and the other TNW related mods are for only Two Worlds version 1.5.
